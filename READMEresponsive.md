## freeCodeCamp

As stated in their [website](https://www.freecodecamp.org), freeCodeCamp "is a tiny non-profit that's helping millions of people learn to code for free". freeCodeCamp is indeed helping me learn to code and I suggest that everyone interested in coding should check their [curriculum](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) and their method. I'm sure that they won't mind if you also start [supporting](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) their effort.
